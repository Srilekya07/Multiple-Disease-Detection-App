# 🩺 Multiple Disease Detection App
## 📋 Project Overview
A deep learning web application for detecting multiple diseases from medical images, built with **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and **Streamlit**.  
Empowering faster diagnosis and supporting healthcare professionals with AI.

> ⚠️ Note: Some large trained model files (`.h5`/`.pkl`) for Skin and Brain Tumor detection are **excluded** due to size constraints.

## 📌 Project Overview
This app brings together several disease detection models under a single, unified interface:
- 🧪 Eye Disease Detection
- 🫁 Lung Disease Classification
- 🧵 Skin Cancer Classification 
- 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection 
Upload medical images to get real-time predictions powered by convolutional neural networks.
